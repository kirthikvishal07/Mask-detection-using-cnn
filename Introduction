🩺 Real-Time Face Mask Detection using CNN

This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model classifies whether a person is wearing a mask 😷 or not wearing a mask 🙅 in live video streams.

🚀 Features

Real-time mask detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras

Face detection + CNN classifier pipeline

Works on images, video, and webcam streams

Supports multi-person detection in a single frame

Lightweight and optimized for fast inference

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow/Keras – CNN for mask classification

OpenCV – real-time face detection & video processing

NumPy / Matplotlib – data handling & visualization

📊 Dataset

Custom dataset with two classes:

with_mask

without_mask

Augmented with rotation, brightness, flipping for better generalization

⚙️ How It Works

Detect faces in the frame using OpenCV/face detector

Crop and preprocess the face

Pass it through the trained CNN model

Display results with bounding boxes and labels (Mask / No Mask)
